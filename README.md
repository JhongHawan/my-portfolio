# My Portfolio

## SUMMARY
My web portfolio showcasing some of the work I have done both in school and on my own time. There is a mix of both user research, web design, and software/web development. The idea is to share my working process for each of the projects and to present the final outcomes.

This project was a challenge for me because I wanted to build it from scratch and used basic html, css, and javascript to get started. Reactive websites are popular in todays industry but I believe it is still important to know the fundamentals and creating my portfolio was a great way to test my own fundamental web development skills.
