        <h4>SUMMARY</h4>
        <p>
          I was able to take part in a research group focused on promoting reflection
          in engineering education. The goal was to utilize ideation and prototyping in
          a short period of time to end up with a set of possible solutions. Our users
          were members of CPREE (the Consortium to Promote Reflection in Engineering Education).
          We divided the work between three groups that focused on different elements of the project.

        <h4>CHOOSING ROLES</h4>

        <p>
          There were actually different aspects to our topic that our professors wanted
          to focus on. After discussion we decided to split the project into three smaller
          focus areas that would all help in bringing more attention to the idea of reflection in
          engineering disciplines. I volunteered to be a part of the marketing team where
          we generated ideas on how to raise awareness of the importance of reflection in
          engineering classrooms.

        <h4>IDEATION</h4>

        <p>
          Our next step was to start on the ideation process as a group. We came up with
          multiple ideas such as an online forumn and a brochure/flyer. We focused on
          sketching out our ideas using both divergent and convergent thinking.

        <h4>SOLUTION</h4>
        <p>
          Giving out swag bags at TED talks and engineering events(in the form of string backpacks)
        </p>

          The swag bag contains multiple items that act as marketing resources.
          Items such as business cards, brochures, and USB drives would provide
          information behind CPREE and on the importance of reflection in
          engineering education.

        <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
        <p>
          This was my first time experiencing how the design process works and
          working in a research team. Joining the marketing team showed allowed
          me to branch away from my comfort zone and I got to experience product
          design without even knowing it. I was able to develop new skills in
          prototyping and user research. Being able to prototype a design was a
          truly rewarding experience and I am thankful to HCDE faculty Terri
          Lovins and Jennifer Turns for allowing me to be a part of the research team.
