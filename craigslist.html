        <h4>SUMMARY</h4>
        <p>
          This is a side project I worked on over the course of three weeks.
          It was a great way for me to practice my design skills and conduct
          some user research on my own. The quote above does an effective job
          of summing up my thought process for this redesign. Craigslist has a
          dedicated userbase and the success of the website is still evident
          today. My research and design sections explain more on why I chose
          to focus on UI rather than toying with a lot of the features of the
          website. I took what I learned from the classroom/research and
          applied those skills to create a design that I'm satisfied with.
          At least for now...
        </p>

        <h4>RESEARCH</h4>
        <p id="craigslist-user">
          Craigslist has a huge user base, even with its outdated layout.
          So what makes it so successful?
        </p>
        <h4>HERE'S WHAT I FOUND</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Choosing which categories to display.</li>
          <li>Easy to navigate and the options are well organized.</li>
          <li>Doesn't fill the screen with advertisements.</li>
          <li>It's just been around for a while.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This overall simplicity and reliability of the site seem to be the big
          selling points. I experienced this myself as I was navigating through
          the different pages. It's not the most exciting website, but it gets
          the job done. I've created a user flow to give a better sense of how
          the process works. 
        </p>
        <h4>USER FLOW</h4>
        <img src="img/craigslist/Craigslist-User-Flow.png" alt="userFlow">
        <hr>
        <h4>DESIGN</h4>
        <h5>MY APPROACH</h5>
        <p>
          The user flow is a great representation of how the site as a simplistic interface.
          It's easy to use and that's a selling point for avid users. And if it's not broken,
          then why fix it? For my redesign, I wanted to keep this simple and elegant format
          in mind. I decided to keep most of the features already implemented, such as the
          item filtration systems and categories. I wanted to make them clearer and easier
          to read for users. A lot of the small blue text can clutter up the screen so I
          wanted to add more visible icons. Many of the different options felt out of
          place on the screen, so I reorganized the format and placement of them. 
        </p>
        <img src="img/craigslist/Craigslist-Homepage-Redesign.png" alt="craigslistHomepage">
        <img src="img/craigslist/Item-Listing-Page-Redesign.png" alt="craigslistListing">
        <img src="img/craigslist/Item-View-Page.png" alt="craigslistItem">
        <p>
          The homepage is the piece I am most proud of because I believe it fully captures
          the simplicity of the original layout but with a modern twist. The page image would
          change depending on the location a person chooses. The categories are all laid out
          similar to the column format of the original website except there are now images to help
          identify each category. If I had more time I would edit the designs of the
          other two pages because I think they look slightly cluttered at the moment.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
        <p>
          This side project was my first time researching, designing, and prototyping something
          on my own. It was a great project for me to test what I learned from the classroom and
          undergraduate research teams. I had to run through the various steps of the design
          process to come up with these final designs and it was a great experience. If I had more
          time I would definitely brush up the design some more and work on actually coding the
          website or developing an interactive prototype. Although it was a challenge, this
          was an extremely rewarding experience and I hope to do more work in the future.
